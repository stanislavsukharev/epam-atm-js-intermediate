## 📁 Project Structure & Naming Conventions

This project follows the **Page Object Model** (POM) and organizes files clearly:

| Folder/File                     | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `src/pages/`                   | Contains all Playwright page objects         |
| `src/tests/`                   | Contains Playwright test specs               |
| `src/test-data/`               | Contains Playwright test data                |
| `src/fixtures/`                | Custom Playwright fixtures                   |
| `src/utils/`                   | Utility modules (e.g. CSV parsing)           |
| `base.page.ts`                 | Base class for shared page object logic      |
| `cloud-sql.page.ts`            | Page object for Cloud SQL calculator section |
| `cloud-storage.page.ts`        | Page object for Cloud Storage section        |
| `compute-engine.page.ts`       | Page object for Compute Engine section       |
| `cloud-sql.spec.ts`            | End-to-end tests for Cloud SQL calculator    |
| `cloud-storage.spec.ts`        | End-to-end tests for Cloud Storage           |
| `compute-engine.spec.ts`       | End-to-end tests for Compute Engine          |
| `export-estimate-as-csv.spec.ts`| Verifies download and validation of estimates as CSV |
| `csv-utils.ts`                 | Validates downloaded CSV files               |
| `calculator.data.ts`           | Test data used in calculator scenarios       |
| `fixtures.ts`                  | Defines reusable fixtures for tests          |

Naming follows the pattern:  
`*.page.ts` — Page Object  
`*.spec.ts` — Test Spec  
`*.data.ts` — Test Data  
`*.utils.ts` — Utility Module

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://git.epam.com/stanislav_sukharev/atm-js-intermediate.git`

2. Navigate to project directory:

`cd atm-js-intermediate`

3. Install dependencies:

`npm install`

## Running Tests

- Run tests in Chromium only:

`npm run test:playwright:chromium`

- Run tests in all browsers:

`npm run test:playwright:all`

## **Visual Testing**
- Run all visual regression tests:

`npx playwright test tests/visual.spec.ts`

- To update snapshots:

`npx playwright test tests/visual.spec.ts --update-snapshots`

## Reporting

This project is configured to generate the following reports:

1. **HTML Report**: After test execution, an HTML report with test details, screenshots, videos, and traces for failed tests is generated in the `playwright-report` directory. The report does not open automatically.

2. **JUnit Report**: A JUnit-compatible XML report is saved in the `results/` directory as `junit-results.xml`.

3. **Report Portal**: Test results are sent to [Report Portal](https://reportportal.epam.com) under the personal project "stanislav_sukharev_personal". Make sure the `apiKey` and `project` are correctly configured in `playwright.config.ts`.

## ESLint Configuration

The project uses **ESLint** for linting with the following configuration:

1. **Plugins**:
   - `eslint-plugin-playwright` for Playwright-specific rules.
   - `eslint-plugin-prettier` for integrating Prettier with ESLint.

2. **Scripts**:
- To run ESLint:
     
`npm run lint`
     
- To automatically fix issues:
    
`npm run lint:fix`


3. **Configuration**:
   - Rules for Prettier are set to **warn**.
   - Playwright-specific linting rules such as `no-focused-test` and `no-skipped-test` are enforced.
   - The following files and directories are ignored from linting and Git:
     - `node_modules/`, `playwright-report/`, `results/`, `.env`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`

## Git Ignore

The following files and folders are excluded from version control:

- `node_modules/`
- `playwright-report/`
- `results/`
- `.env`
- `.idea/`
- `.vscode/`

## Technologies Used

| Tool             | Purpose                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Playwright       | Modern browser automation        |
| TypeScript       | Type-safe codebase               |
| Playwright Test  | Built-in Playwright test runner  |
| POM Pattern      | Maintainable test structure      |
| ESLint           | Code linting and style enforcement |
| Prettier         | Code formatting                  |
| csv-parse	       | CSV parsing and transformation   |

## Notes
The CSV download logic is tested via export-estimate-as-csv.spec.ts, and validated using custom logic from csv-utils.ts.
Make sure the expected cost value is aligned with the test data when asserting CSV content.
